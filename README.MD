## Motivation
Creating a Tic Tac Toe game is a project that holds a special significance for me. It represents a milestone in my journey to learn JavaScript and showcases my understanding of fundamental programming concepts. Tic Tac Toe, being a childhood favorite, serves as a perfect opportunity to apply my newfound skills and challenge myself as a developer. By building this game, I aim to provide a user-friendly experience that captures the essence of the original game and offers both entertainment and nostalgia.

## How to Play
1. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
2. You will see a 3x3 grid representing the Tic Tac Toe board.
3. Two players take turns marking empty cells on the grid with their respective symbols (X or O).
4. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
5. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Player vs player: The game supports a two-player mode, enabling users to play against each other. 
- Reset Button: Added a reset button that allows players to restart the game at any time. Clicking the reset button clears  the board and resets the game state, allowing players to start a new round.
- Winning Detection: The game incorporates an algorithm to detect winning moves. It checks the game board after each move to determine if a player has achieved a winning condition (three in a row, column, or diagonal). Once a winner is detected, the game announces the victorious player.


## Not Implemented
- Custom Images: The feature to use custom images in place of X and O symbols has not been implemented yet. This would allow players to select and use their own images for their moves, making the game more personalized and unique.
